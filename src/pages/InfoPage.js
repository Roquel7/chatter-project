            This is a page that will just have information on what I am doing. Really just using this
            as another tab on the Menu to make it a little more full. I might type what I need to 
            do in here to so that I can have that as I go. 

            I need to find a way to keep the messages I send in order. I also need to find way to where certain
            stay with the specific channel they were created at. 

        </div>
