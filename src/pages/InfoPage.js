            This is a page that will just have information on what I am doing. Really just using this
            as another tab on the Menu to make it a little more full. I might type what I need to 
            do in here to so that I can have that as I go. 

            1. I will have my channels be stateful, then I will try to have the messages and stateless and using reducer fo this one.
